# Concrete Crack Images for Classification
 The aim of the project is identify cracks on concrete images using convolutional neural network. This project is a computer vision task where it is a binary classification problem. The model is trained with a dataset of 400000 images where 200000 images is divided equally between positive (cracks) and negative (no cracks) classes.
